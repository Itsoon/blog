# ðŸ“š How to convert a binary number to decimal?

> Binary is a numbering system based on 2, where each digit (called a bit) can be either 0 or 1. Each bit represents a power of 2, starting from 2^0 on the right.

## Step-by-step method:

1. Write down the binary number.
2. Associate a power of 2 with each bit, starting from the right.
3. Multiply each bit by the corresponding power of 2.
4. Add everything together to get the decimal number.

ðŸ”Ž Example: Convert 10110 (binary) to decimal

The binary number 10110 corresponds to:
1Ã—2^4 + 0Ã—2^3 + 1Ã—2^2 + 1Ã—2^1 + 0Ã—2^0

Let's calculate each term:

- 1Ã—2^4 = 16
- 0Ã—2^3 = 0
- 1Ã—2^2 = 4
- 1Ã—2^1 = 2
- 0Ã—2^0 = 0

Now, let's add them up:
16 + 0 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 22

Therefore, 10110 (binary) = 22 (decimal).
