# List Users on Linux

> If you need to list all the users on your Linux system, you can use a few different methods to retrieve this information. Here are the most common approaches:

## Method 1: Using `/etc/passwd`

The `/etc/passwd` file contains information about the system's users. You can view it to find all usernames:

```shell
cat /etc/passwd
```

Each line in the file represents a user, for example:

```
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
user1:x:1000:1000::/home/user1:/bin/bash
user2:x:1001:1001::/home/user2:/bin/bash
```

In this example, the usernames are `root`, `user1`, and `user2`.

### Using awk to Extract Usernames

`awk` extract just the usernames from the `/etc/passwd` file, you can use awk to print the first field (the username) from each line:

```shell
awk -F: '{print $1}' /etc/passwd
```

## Method 2: Using getent passwd

The getent command can retrieve the list of users from various sources, such as local files or network services like LDAP. To list all users, run:

```shell
getent passwd
```
This will provide similar output to the [cat /etc/passwd command](/blog/linux/list-users-linux#method-1-using-cat-etc-passwd).

## Method 3: Using `ls /home`

If your system uses the `/home` directory to store user files, you can list the user directories, which correspond to user accounts:

```shell
ls /home
```

This will show the directories in `/home`, each of which corresponds to a user account on the system.
